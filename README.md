## OMSCS Hours Average

This project is for OMSCS students to average the hours spent per week studying for a class. The requirement is for the hours to be logged in a `csv` file by the end of the class.

An example of the CSV file:
```
Week1,5-14,2
,5-16,3
,5-18,4.5
,5-19,4.5
Week2,5-20,5.5
,5-21,4
,5-22,2
,5-24,1
,5-25,5
,5-26,1
```
